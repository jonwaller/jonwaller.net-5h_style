This site is an experiment building something that conforms with my enneagram. That is:
Control -> Self love -> Connection -> Selfless contribution -> Release -> Play -> Control

Happiness, I believe, comes from self-love, connection, and selfless contribution. 
Additionally it can also come from "Play".

The key item, connection, is based on quality. All pages need to connect (make the user love them, though quality and authenticity), regardless of stated purpose.

This site attempts to:

/ Connect deeply
/bio/ Show my self love though showing my abilities, experience and personal history. Be a storyteller. - This builds trust
/work/ Show how I can help *YOU*, the user. Shows how I contribute to the world.
Optionally:
/play/ Let's the user play with "lack of control" for a little. (Or, less ideally, could show how I do so)


How to connect:
-Be vunrable
-Listen
-"it's how you make them feel"
-Talk to them 1 to 1 
-...or 1 to 2
-Be yourself, no pedestal
-"I'm a human, this is what i feel"

---

really liking yourself. really, truly connecting. really caring about others
